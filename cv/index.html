            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <article>
                <p>I'm a web and software developer with over 10 years national, and international experience and I'm passionate about what I do.</p>
                <p>I am currently in permanent employment, but I will consider other permanent positions, full remote, or in the West Surrey area.</p>
                <p>My knowledge of front-end development, back-end development and some level of systems administration makes me ideally suited to front-end heavy full-stack engineering roles that need to be very independent, and requiring a broad knowledge of technologies to get projects done.</p>
                <p>I have a Master of Science in Networks Systems Engineering from the University of Plymouth, as well as a French "diplôme d'ingénieur" from the ESIEA school of electronics and computing in Paris.</p>
                <p>I speak Fluent French and English, as well as Spanish at a very basic level.</p>

                <p>I have mentored one of our developers to switch to ReactJs development, and am helping others traditionally backend developers to have go as well, with great success for the business.</p>
                <p>All this is part of the large transformation of the existing code-base, bringing in translations and associated tooling, and the development of new features for demanding customers in an industry traditionally very conservative.</p>

                <p>Part of my assignment was to bring expertise of ReactJs / Redux, as well as SCSS, BEM and git workflows, as well as take part in mentoring juniors arriving in the company.</p>
