                <h1>Git post-receive for multiple remote branches and work-trees</h1>
            </header>

            <p>A while ago I set up my server to automatically deploy new content from my git repositories when changes where pushed to them. This automatic workflow is great and fairly simple to setup, but I recently needed to add a twist to it: what if I want to deploy separate remote branches to their own individual work-trees? Here&#8217;s how&#8230;</p>

<p class="attachement"><span><img src="http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2011-10-22-git-post-receive-for-multiple-remote-branches-and-work-trees/gitflow.png" alt="Gitflow" /></span></p>




<!--more-->


<p>Below is a walkthrough of my findings along the way of debugging the initial implementation, but if you&#8217;re in a hurry, you can go straight to <a href="#rightsol">the solution</a></p>

<h2>Initial, single remote branch setup</h2>

<p>The initial setup has been explained here before, so you only have to follow <a href="/automated-deployment-on-remote-server-with-git/" title="automated deployment on remote server with git">these basic instructions</a> to get yourself going on a single master branch auto-deployment.</p>

<h2>More branches, more work-trees please!</h2>

<p>Right, now let&#8217;s say you want not only the master branch of your code to be deployed to a live website, but you also want the development branch to be deployed to it&#8217;s own web root directory so you can test a development version of your site (and potentially f** it all up) while the live site still runs the last &#8220;gold&#8221; version of your code. You will undoubtedly have several local branches, several corresponding tracking remote branches. For this setup, you will also need several corresponding work-trees, all with their automated deployments upon pushing to the main repository.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, there is very little to change to our method explained in the <a href="/automated-deployment-on-remote-server-with-git/" title="Automated deployment on remote server with git">previous setup</a>, but the basic instructions I found did not initially work on my Ubuntu server, so you&#8217;ll have to be aware of a few things.</p>

<h3>Initial findings</h3>

<p>Dylan over dylanserver.com posted this <a title="Git post-receive hook for live branch" href="http://dylansserver.com/note/git_post-receive_hook/" target="_blank">handy bit of code</a> earlier this year:</p>

<pre>
  if ! [ -t 0 ]; then
    read -a ref
  fi

  IFS='/' read -ra REF <<< "${ref[2]}"

  branch="${REF[2]}"

  if [ "live" == "$branch" ]; then
    git --work-tree=/var/www/dylanstestserver.com/ --git-dir=.. checkout -f
    echo 'Changes pushed live.'
  fi
</pre>


<p>If you read carefully the post, you can notice that the checkout command is still there, but augmented with the &ndash;work-tree and &ndash;git-dir arguments.</p>

<p>Great! Thats a great starting point, firing up vi on my remote server, I edited my &lsquo;post-receive&rsquo; hook and pasted the following code in it (after changing the branch name to &ldquo;dev&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;live&rdquo; to test only with my dev site). Note that I had also added the shebang at the top of the file&hellip;</p>

<pre>
  #!bin/sh
  if ! [ -t 0 ]; then
    read -a ref
  fi

  IFS='/' read -ra REF <<< "${ref[2]}"

  branch="${REF[2]}"

  if [ "dev" == "$branch" ]; then
    git --work-tree=/path/under/root/dir/dev-site/ --git-dir=.. checkout -f
    echo 'Changes pushed dev.'
  fi
</pre>


<p>The next git push executed the hook but I got the following error in the git push output:</p>

<pre>read: 4: Illegal option -a</pre>


<h3>The right shebang</h3>

<p>The problem was that the shebang I added uses sh, which, according to some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2462317/bash-syntax-error-redirection-unexpected/2462357#2462357" title="Bash: Syntax error: redirection unexpected" target="_blank">stackoverflow answers</a> doesn&rsquo;t use bash on ubuntu (my server). Incidentally, I found this out after fiddling around with the read command and removing the -a option, only to find out that an &ldquo;unexpected redirect&rdquo; has been found.</p>

<p>The solution was simple: change the shebang to:</p>

<pre>#!bin/bash</pre>


<p>Now, that hook was going to checkout my dev branch into my development site&rsquo;s root directory&hellip; err&hellip; Not quite yet.</p>

<h3>The right git directory</h3>

<p>The next error I encountered was:</p>

<pre>fatal: Not a git repository: '..'</pre>


<p>That&rsquo;s from the script itself, but I can&rsquo;t understand why this was failing, as &ndash;git-dir should accept absolute or relative directories. However, the GIT_DIR environment variable should be set to the current directory, which during the push, is the git directory. So I elected to remove the option altogether:</p>

<pre>
  #!bin/sh
  if ! [ -t 0 ]; then
    read -a ref
  fi

  IFS='/' read -ra REF <<< "${ref[2]}"

  branch="${REF[2]}"

  if [ "dev" == "$branch" ]; then
    git --work-tree=/path/under/root/dir/dev-site/ checkout -f
    echo 'Changes pushed dev.'
  fi
</pre>


<p>Now the push didn&rsquo;t report any error, and &ldquo;some&rdquo; code to the correct development website root directory! Yay!
BUT&hellip; That code was the MASTER branch&rsquo;s code. Not the DEV branch.</p>

<p><a id="rightsol"></a></p>

<h2>The right solution</h2>

<p>As all we are doing in the hook is performing a git checkout (with some options), we can simply pass the branch we want to checkout as a parameter and all works well!
I&rsquo;m yet to understand what environment variables are set and used by the hook, but for the moment, my final post-receive hook looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>Edit - Thanks to Peter and his comments below, the script below now works while pushing multiple branches at once! Thanks to him!</strong></p>

<pre>
  #!/bin/bash

  while read oldrev newrev ref
  do
    branch=`echo $ref | cut -d/ -f3`

    if [ "master" == "$branch" ]; then
      git --work-tree=/path/under/root/dir/live-site/ checkout -f $branch
      echo 'Changes pushed live.'
    fi

    if [ "dev" == "$branch" ]; then
      git --work-tree=/path/under/root/dir/dev-site/ checkout -f $branch
      echo 'Changes pushed to dev.'
    fi
  done
</pre>


<p>You will notice I have added the master branch in there too, and you can expand the script with whatever branch you want to checkout, along with the correct work-tree.</p>

        <p>It seems that this version of the hook doesn't fully work in scenarios where I'm pushing both master and dev (read multi-branches push) to the remote.
As the script is executed once, I'm not sure if the references are correctly set.
Maybe all this should go in a different hook?

Suggestions?</p>

        <p>To solve Matt's problem I think this whole script should be wrapped in a while loop.

I took the post-receive script from <a href='http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html'>http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html</a> and combined it with yours to come up with a new version.  I haven't tested it, but it should would work for multi-branch commits:</p><pre><code>
-----------------
#!/bin/sh
#
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
	IFS='/' read -ra REF &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;${ref}&quot;

	branch=&quot;${REF[2]}&quot;

        <p>Hi Peter, I'll give that one a go, that looks alright to me.
I did not have time yet to investigate myself but that's what I had in mind as well.

I'll try that asap and report.

        <p>The last one I posted won't work unless you change the shabang.  Here's a better version that should be a little easier to read.  I have tested this one successfully.

        <p>And here is a version you can use if your live site is <strong>on another server</strong>. Keep in mind that you will have to setup a user who can ssh to the other server using keys instead of passwords to authenticate. I’m sure you can find those instructions online.

</p><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

        <p>Hi Peter, I've edited your comments so they look alright. They won't show indenting as I don't apply the pretty formatter to those. That's for another time!

Regarding your code, I can confirm that the second one you posted (for a solution on the same server) does work properly and I've updated my original post as well to reflect those changes, which should help a few out there!

Thanks a lot!</p>

        <p>I've a little problem here...

Here is step by step that i'm doing:

</p><pre><code>server:
--------------------
cd /home/git/repositories
mkdir project.git
cd project.git
git init --bare

localhost
--------------------
cd /var/www/project
git init
git remote add origin git@server.com:project.git
git add .
git commit -m "first export"
git push origin master</code></pre><p>

For now, "tutto bene" (is fine). I want to use the master branch as development branch, so, any push to master branch, deploy to dev/test server, and i want to add another branch for production enviroment, "production" branch. So I edit my config and post-receive files in server:

</p><pre><code>Server
-----------------------
cd /home/git/repositories/project.git
git config core.bare false
git config receive.denycurrentbranch ignore

nano hooks/post-receive
--------------------------
#!/bin/bash
#
livepath="/path/to/your/live"
devpath="/path/to/your/dev"
while read oldrev newrev ref
do
branch=`echo $ref | cut -d/ -f3`
if [[ "production" == "$branch" ]]; then
git --work-tree=$livepath checkout -f $branch
echo 'Changes pushed live.'
elif [[ "master" == "$branch" ]]; then
git --work-tree=$devpath checkout -f $branch
echo 'Changes pushed to dev.'
fi
done
--------------------------
</code></pre><p>
Now I change some code and push it to test/dev (master):
</p><pre><code>git commit -a -m "changed some files"
git push origin master</code></pre><p>

Fine, works for test/dev deploy, now test with production branch:

</p><pre><code>localhost
-------------------------
git checkout -b production
git push origin production</code></pre><p>

I push production branch to the origin because, that way, other developers can merge and push to production your works...

now I merge master into production, for deploy a copy of test/dev into production enviroment:

git merge master
git push

Fine!!!, deployed into production server, awesome!!

OK, here come the bad think, now i change to master branch to fix some bug, push to dev/test, and.... nothing, don't deploy to test/dev server... Try again and nothing...

</p><pre><code>git checkout master
nano bad_file.php
---
git commit -a -m "fixed the bug 1"
git push origin master</code></pre><p>
............. not deploy, como on mother f....
</p><pre><code>nano bad_file.php
---
git commit -a -m "fixed the bug 2"
git push origin master</code></pre><p>
............. not deploy

Let me try mergin master into production:
</p><pre><code>git checkout production
git merge master
git push origin production</code></pre><p>
............. deploy into production

Come back to master an push some change...
</p><pre><code>git checkout master
nano bad_file.php
---
git commit -a -m "fixed bug 3"
git push origin master</code></pre><p>
............ deployed into dev/test server, but no the commit "fixed bug 3", instead the second commit .... :(

Any suggestion?</p>

        <p>Hey Gustavo!
Other than some permission issues, I don't see what could be wrong here, as your method looks ok to me.

To debug what is happening, instead of doing a checkout in the "master branch block", you could stick in there a bunch of logging lines of code that would print the git history being pushed and on which $ref you are etc.</p>

        <p>Sorry to post in an old page.

I have been trying to set up a deployment similar to this, but I have been having an issue with speed.  With both the script I wrote and the script here, it will sometimes take 15 minutes for a push to complete.  It seems to me that the problem is when switching between the two working directories.  When I push the same branch as I had previously, it only takes a few seconds to make a small change.  However, if I had last pushed the master branch and now push the dev branch, it will take 15 minutes to complete, even just to make one change on a 2kB file.  Additionally, it this case, windows shows all the files in the directory as having been modified, rather than just the 1 file that had been changed and committed.</p>

        <p>Wonderful. Just a few questions...

I'd like to incorporate this method without running or managing a git server like gitolite,... preferring to rely on GitHub and Bitbucket for things like collaboration, user management, rwx permissions, etc.

So...

a) Does a server running git and ssh qualify for using this, or is something like gitolite a must?

b) Imagining a scenario in which you have some code that is part of a site that needs local =&gt; stage and =&gt; live branches, as well as a version that lives on Bitbucket or GH,...erhm...what might that look like?

In other words, is there a sensible way of managing both sharing/collaboration AND the convenience of "push publishing", or is that asking too much of one repo?</p>

        <p>Hi David,

I'll try to answer your questions below:

a)
Gitolite is only a permissions management system for repositories, not git itself. This is a git hook, so it should work on any git install providing that you modify the script to use the correct file system.

You can also write the same script in pretty much any language the shell of said server can interpret. This is bash, but you could use ruby and others.

You can find a more advanced script doign something else here: <a href='http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-An-Example-Git-Enforced-Policy'>http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-An-Example-Git-Enforced-Policy</a>

b)
There is nothing that would prevent you from building a more complex script, checking what branch you are pushing to and deploying the right code to the right staging, integration, live etc servers. Just bare in mind that this particular hook above is only intended to work on the same machine than the repository is.
But because these hooks are essentially scripts, you can do whatever you want in them, even stuff completely unrelated to git itslef, like sending an email to all your team telling them you've pushed code etc.

I don't have example of such scripts handy, but that's essentially how heroku or openshift work. The sharing/collaboration is the pure git branch part, the push-publish is in the hooks.

I don't think the limitation will be in the repo here, but in how complex your hooks and management system will be.</p>

        <p>Thanks, Matt. Cleared up a lot for me. This solution is working great for me.

I'd also like to recommend this write-up...

<a href='http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto'>http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto</a>

...which covers some of the fundamentals you cover in part I. You can use the script Peter came up with in this solution as well. Very clever.</p>

        <p>This worked perfectly for me. I've been looking for exactly this sort of solution for months. Not sure how I didn't come across this earlier.

I created a Gist with my slightly modified version.

Hopefully that'll make it easier to contribute to this block of code in the future. Fork and modify to your heart's content.

Thanks again!</p>

        <p>I encountered a problem with pushing my master branch to the live site.

My workflow is as follows:

- make changes locally on develop branch, test, commit, push to develop
- test on server (develop url)
- merge develop into master on local, push to master

The problem is that when I push to master, files that I deleted locally don't get removed on the server. New files are added as expected. This only happens when I push to master, pushing to develop works just fine.

Any ideas?</p>

        <p>Norbert, I am unsure why this happens, but possible issues could include file permissions that could be different for whatever reason on the directories your master branch checks out into, or you may have had some files in there prior to deploying with git. If these files weren't in your repository before, then it's normal they won't get deleted since git doesn't track them.
That's only speculation though.
