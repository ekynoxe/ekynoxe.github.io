                <title>Closing the Hammersmith Barrier website</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2011, I got fed up with the Hammersmith council and TFL not rising up to take ownership of the Hammersmith bridge barriers being constantly broken.
I was cycling to work through the bridge every day, and most of the time, the bus lane barriers would be broken, on the side of the road, if not dangling from their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-02-09-closing-the-hammersmith-barrier-website/original.png&quot; title=&quot;One of the many days the south barrier was broken&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140209]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-02-09-closing-the-hammersmith-barrier-website/original_r300.png&quot; alt=&quot;One of the many days the south barrier was broken&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It led all sorts of traffic go through the bridge, including some that should not have gone there like vans and small trucks.
As a cyclist, this was dangerous, and I thought that with a record of the sate of the barrier everyday through the week, it would highlight the lack of attention that this road feature was receiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not only for cycling safety, but to preserve the bridge from being crammed with vehicles too big, and it was failing this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the little website that I created, I reported every time I went through there, most of the time with photographic evidence, the state of both north and south barriers, and the statistics very shocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 7 months the website had been up, the south barrier was broken for more than 70% of the time, while the north one was out of action 20% of the time. But because the roads (or bus lanes) are part of the TFL network, they were spending the minimum amount of money on it, while the council didn&amp;rsquo;t want to hear about the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was an interesting experiment in capturing everyday waste of public money, time and effort, for a solution that could have been converted to rising bollards or another, less likely to break piece of traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I changed jobs and I&amp;rsquo;m no longer cycling through the Hammersmith bridge, so I can&amp;rsquo;t record the status of those barriers any-more. I&amp;rsquo;ve therefore decided to close the site for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for those who knew about it and had a little interest!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-02-09-closing-the-hammersmith-barrier-website/hammersmith_barrier.jpg&quot; title=&quot;The Hammersmith barrier website&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[20140209]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-02-09-closing-the-hammersmith-barrier-website/hammersmith_barrier_r300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Hammersmith barrier website&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Below is what the site description read when it was up and running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hammersmith bridge bus lanes feature barriers to prevent HGVs and other heavy vehicles to access the bridge, as it&amp;rsquo;s not been designed to withstand the weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these barriers are broken, out of order, or removed regularly, sometimes posing serious risks to passers by. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/37791955&quot; title=&quot;the barrier strikes back&quot;&gt;The barrier strikes back&lt;/a&gt; shows this, where the barrier falls in front of 3 cyclists that were going through the lane. Dangling from a cable inside the tube, the barrier was simply swinging one side to the other, and pedestrians could have been injured as well.
Fairly recent articles on &lt;a href=&quot;http://focustransport2011.blogspot.co.uk/2011/11/calls-to-tackle-bus-drivers-over-bridge.html&quot; title=&quot;Focus transport on the Hammersmith barrier&quot;&gt;Focus transport&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-15843353&quot; title=&quot;BBC article&quot;&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fulhamchronicle.co.uk/fulham-and-hammersmith-news/2011/11/23/bus-drivers-caught-tearing-down-hammersmith-bridge-safety-barrier-82029-29828153/&quot; title=&quot;Fulham and Hammersmith news: Bus drivers caught tearing down Hammersmith bridge safety barrier&quot;&gt;Fulham and Hammersmith Chronicle&lt;/a&gt; have shown that bus drivers themselves sometimes remove the barriers so they can go over the bridge. They claim it&amp;rsquo;s because the barriers don&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rationale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By recording the status of the bus lane barriers when I pass them (it&amp;rsquo;s on my daily commute), I want to have a demonstration of their uselessness, and I want to present this as wastage of public money towards the constant repairs of the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can argue that the cyclists mentioned above should not have been in the lane, but frankly, I&amp;rsquo;d question first the design of the cycle route leading the the South access to the bridge. &lt;a href=&quot;http://vimeo.com/35142018&quot; title=&quot;Misleading road markings&quot;&gt;This video&lt;/a&gt; Shows the markings indicating cyclists to get on the &amp;ldquo;shared pavement&amp;rdquo;, for the only purpose to go around the barrier. Doing this is dangerous for both cyclists and pedestrians and could be avoided very easily! A study by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.richmondlcc.co.uk/2010/11/08/another-veloteer-review-hammersmith-bridge/&quot; title=&quot;Richmond Cycling Campaign: Another veloteer review Hammersmith bridge&quot;&gt;Richmond Cycling campaign&lt;/a&gt; has shown this for a long time now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the cycle lane design issue, simply shortening the barrier by a feet or two would allow cyclists to pass by (when the barrier works, obviously) while still preventing large vehicles to go through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solution to the barrier itself would be to use rising bollards instead of a barrier. Maybe there would be a higher upfront cost, but that would be offset by not spending money on constant repairs. They certainly seem to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRCA8MvedIo&quot; title=&quot;Another solution&quot;&gt;work well in Manchester&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would also fix the cycle lane layout, by allowing cyclist to pass between the bollards, and not have to go on the &amp;ldquo;shared&amp;rdquo; pavement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Solex 3800: Something to restore and cherish</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, I inherited my mum&amp;#8217;s speed machine! A 1967 VeloSolex that has spent the best part of the last 30 years in a dark garage on the Normandy peninsula coast in France.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Should you know TCP/IP to work for a web company?</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;An interesting discussion (argument?) popped in my tweets yesterday in the form of TCP/IP knowledge depth to be able to work at a web company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-25-should-you-know-tcpip-to-work-for-a-web-company/tweetshot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The tweet that prompted it all&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;That quickly prompted quite a few replies from developers and techs leads of different levels and knowledge, including myself, but none of us asked the question: &amp;#8220;for which role?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of different roles at a web company, and if we exclude the obvious non techies ones (I doubt the receptionist gives a damn about MTU and error control), we can still argue about the depth of network knowledge required to occupy a technical role.
Let&amp;#8217;s be clear here: we&amp;#8217;re &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; talking about connecting your laptop to your corporate wifi network, but about network protocols and how they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The pure front-end developer: &lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;d argue you only need some very small basics, if any, about network protocols to do an awesome job without any problem. I hope you know what an IP address is, and that&amp;#8217;s possibly the only thing you&amp;#8217;ll need. If you don&amp;#8217;t, dig it up, but don&amp;#8217;t learn the whole CCNA syllabus. No need. Knowing HTTP, on the other hand, is not an option these days, even for &amp;#8220;pure front-enders&amp;#8221; who&amp;#8217;ll most likely have to do something with asynchronous javaScript calls at some point or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The all rounder&lt;/strong&gt;: If, like me, you&amp;#8217;re one of those, doing some front end and backend code, you&amp;#8217;ll probably want to know a bit more about what rules data transfers across networks. Having a little knowledge about network protocols, what they generally do and how to ping/trace stuff is a good thing. But I am really not convinced that knowing the inner workings TCP/IP should be a requirement to land you a job. Hands up all rounders who have had to dig in TCP retransmission timeouts or the size of IP datagrams because some packets were being dropped on &amp;#8220;the line&amp;#8221;? Yeah&amp;#8230; I thought so. Probably not many, and the ones who raised their hands either do a networks engineer&amp;#8217;s job, or, like me, did some network studies before falling into development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The back-ender:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s probably a very good asset to have, especially if you work at a web company dealing with large volumes of users, requests, page loads and transactions. Knowing it will probably help a lot in optimisation of data transfers an server communications. I&amp;#8217;d argue here that it is a requirement for you to know where things happen on the network stack. You won&amp;#8217;t need it every day in your job, but you&amp;#8217;ll have an extra weapon in your arsenal in case things get nasty in those lower layers. Having said that, if you don&amp;#8217;t work on networks systems, I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure you can still do an excellent job without the complete knowledge of how IP re-assembles packets or how TCP works out how to retransmis the ones gone astray&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;#8217;re interviewing for a network or systems engineer role, then you should not only know what TCP/IP is, but know its inner workings and its quirks. You should know how to trace errors in packets and be able to identify why some retransmission occurs on the networks you&amp;#8217;ll be managing. At this level, basics aren&amp;#8217;t enough anymore, but this is valid in any IT networks department, regardless of the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with everything, it&amp;#8217;s all a matter of perspective (and remember I&amp;#8217;m more an all-rounder with a strong preference on front-end development), but I&amp;#8217;d argue you don&amp;#8217;t need a very deep understanding of the inner workings TCP/IP and how it works to &amp;#8220;work at a web company&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; view?&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The day one image brought my server down</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;During the viral expansion of the &amp;#8220;Richmond news paper editorial fiasco&amp;#8221;, I submitted &lt;a href=&quot;http://road.cc/content/forum/65843-%E2%80%A6-only-good-cyclist-dead-one-%E2%80%A6%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-editor-richmond-magazine-%E2%80%93-september-issue&quot; title=&quot;“… the only good cyclist is a dead one …” – editor of the richmond magazine – september issue&quot;&gt;a post on the road.cc forum&lt;/a&gt;. In it, I had added an image linked straight from my server&amp;#8230; What a great idea! Linking one of the most read cycling forum in the UK to my own domain! Lots of hits! &amp;#8230; yeah, just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-15-the-day-one-image-brought-my-server-down/one_image_host_down.png&quot; alt=&quot;One image on road.cc...&quot;/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I definitely need to do some memory tweaking there, because that single image, requested by the road.cc page views, brought my server to its knees. Not &amp;#8211; good.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The web has evolved&amp;#8230; Get used to it</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;A year back, I created a nice and simple website for my triathlon club: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.d3triathlon.com&quot; title=&quot;D3 Triathlon&quot;&gt;http://d3triathlon.com&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m used to WordPress, and I know it has an easy interface to create content. So it&amp;#8217;s what I chose to create the site: simple stuff, simple theme with a couple of simple pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time, I requested feedback and inputs from club members about features they wanted to see. I implemented most of them (safely ignoring the &amp;#8220;I want to see a little guy, swim bike and run across the screen&amp;#8221; request&amp;#8230;) to produce what I feel is a decent job for what it&amp;#8217;s supposed to do. A year later, after only one member dared trying to create a new article (successfully though!), I got an email asking me what I thought about using another platform, on which editing &amp;#8220;looks just like word&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; Here&amp;#8217;s some thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the D3triathlon website I created went live, I certainly had nice feedback from everyone at the club. However, from experience, that goes with all club websites, where almost no one has an opinion and says &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s all cool&amp;#8221;. It&amp;#8217;s unfortunately also not uncommon for club sites to have absolutely no content updates whatsoever. Usually, this is because people are scared, lazy, or because it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;too hard to do it&amp;#8221;. I learnt that the hard way on another site I&amp;#8217;ll discuss in another post, by creating a system too complex to do anything with, both in administration and content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for the D3triathlon site, I used WordPress. I really believe that it has all the attributes needed to make a site easily editable from the most technophobe club members you can find. And there should be no risk to mucking things up, as long as permissions are created properly for the accounts having the right to create content. The main problem is not the tool itself, the main problem is attitude towards it. In the year that the website has been live, only one member tried to create content. ONE! But it worked! The content is live! I had to do some minor edits, but he tried it, and that&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s important. If no one tries the system, there is no basis to have an opinion on it being easy to use or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received an email asking me my views on scrapping (or not) what I&amp;#8217;ve done to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.swimesc.co.uk&quot; title=&quot;Swim ESC&quot;&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;attachement&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-13-the-web-has-evolved-get-used-to-it/SWIM_ESC.png&quot; title=&quot;Ealing Swimming club &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; site&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[1370]&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2012-09-13-the-web-has-evolved-get-used-to-it/SWIM_ESC_r500.png&quot; alt=&quot;Ealing Swimming club &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; site&quot; /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ealing Swimming club &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Passed my shock horror reaction when looking at what was labeled a &amp;#8220;new site&amp;#8221;, it was apparent what was the only reason for the idea to move: ease of content edition. The email read literally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;] The new site is very easily updated &amp;#8211; it actually just looks like word when I do it. I need to play around with the edit tool and see if we can upload photos, spreadsheets etc and have links to other sites [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WTF? WordPress does all of that. All. Of. It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it would be a shame to scrap my work, I don&amp;#8217;t have too much of a problem with it. Its the reason being put forward that just didn&amp;#8217;t make sense. That &amp;#8220;new&amp;#8221; platform is clearly a late 90&amp;#8242;s framework that really, really looks bad. There&amp;#8217;s no design work done on it: all hosted club sites look exactly the same (no identity whatsoever). Navigation is impossible to grasp quickly and choice of colors and text sizes are appalling at best. It also has no mobile version, which nowadays is pretty bad given the rate of adoption of mobile browsing. I haven&amp;#8217;t seen the administration side of it, but my guess is that it has a trillion more options than WordPress does, and that content editors feel like they own the whole process: text, photos, colors and placement of content. That was a bad idea at the time such platforms came out, and it still is.The web has moved on a lot since then and it&amp;#8217;s about time whomever wants to manage websites understand why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The web is not, has never been, and should never be &amp;#8220;like MS word&amp;#8221;. Ever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I create websites, I make a point in clarifying who will be responsible for adding and editing content. In this case, a subset of club members. This allows me to identify the needs and how to set things up for the long run. On this particular site, it was clear accounts with limited edition permissions would need to be created, so they can try whatever they want without destroying the whole site by publishing a piece of news formatted the wrong way (read copy paste from MS word here&amp;#8230;). This restriction is probably the main reason why people were either reluctant to try &amp;#8211; or thought there would be no point in &amp;#8211; creating content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;as a content editor limited in publishing options&lt;/strong&gt;, (and only publishing, not creating!) consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can create content as you please. What you cannot do is publish it for everyone to see straight away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can preview content you create at anytime. So even if you&amp;#8217;re restricted in publishing it, you can see how it looks before submitting it for review and acceptance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your content is reviewed by a website manager or another content editor who knows how to do it all better than a newbie, and can also take care of translations and other admin things you don&amp;#8217;t even know need to be done (and shouldn&amp;#8217;t).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t have all the gazillions of options MS Word gives you. THAT&amp;#8217;S AN AWESOME THING because:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have much less options in the interface: it&amp;#8217;s easier to use and much quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You concentrate solely on content. Colors, styling and positioning has already been figured out and taken care of by designers and developers in the style sheet file for the whole site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;#8217;t make the site look crap by putting red text over a fluoerscent green background. No matter how much the kids like it, it&amp;#8217;s a bad idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gives you an opportunity to learn to do things right without putting the whole site down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The website manager approves your content and teaches you how to do things along the way, giving you more and more permissions to do things as you learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;as a content editor, with limited or full access&lt;/strong&gt;, you also have duties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must be willing to learn. If you haven&amp;#8217;t done anything like it before, you must be open to the fact the tool is not necessarily going to look and work the same way than any other programs (&amp;#8230; especially not like MS Word&amp;#8230;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must try it! You&amp;#8217;ve been entrusted with some degree of privileges and given a login/password so you can give it a go. If you don&amp;#8217;t, then you have NOTHING to complain about!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must give feedback. If you don&amp;#8217;t understand or don&amp;#8217;t like something, SAY IT! No one&amp;#8217;s in your head, and developers aren&amp;#8217;t telepaths. (I&amp;#8217;m sure telepaths exist somewhere, though)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you can&amp;#8217;t do it because you&amp;#8217;re lost, or feel it&amp;#8217;s too complex, accept it and communicate it too! It&amp;#8217;s not a shame, some people are better at using new technologies than others. I&amp;#8217;m sure you can find something better suited to what you like doing that these other people don&amp;#8217;t want to / can&amp;#8217;t do anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not ever, ever, EVER make the mistake of saying that &amp;#8220;it doesn&amp;#8217;t look like MS Word&amp;#8221;. MS Word is very good at what it&amp;#8217;s intended to do: digital documents for print. The web is not a document in the same way. If you don&amp;#8217;t want to understand that, then don&amp;#8217;t raise your hand to be a content editor. If you want to understand, then see points 1, 2 and 3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a website developer, designer and manager&lt;/strong&gt;, there are also a few things to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you know who will be entrusted to edit the site&amp;#8217;s content. You want as many as possible for the site to be alive, and as little as possible so it&amp;#8217;s not all a big mess.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make it easy for them to do just that. Make it restrictive, so they don&amp;#8217;t get lost in editing options, and tell them why you do it and the benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure they try it. You&amp;#8217;re partly to blame if they don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fight for your site to live and be updated by the right people. If the reason it doesn&amp;#8217;t work is because &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s not like MS Word&amp;#8221;, then there&amp;#8217;s either some education not done from, or no willingness to do anything from them, or both.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept the fact that in the end, they are the owners of the site and have the ultimate say in what to do with it. If they have all the tools and nothing happens, then the site&amp;#8217;s dead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;editable web&amp;#8221; has evolved a lot from being a static set of nested tables &amp;#8211; auto-generated by tools not designed for that in the first place &amp;#8211; to be a very flexible media, with lots of different responsibilities. On any site, you&amp;#8217;ll developers, designers and content editors. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s all the same person, more often though, it&amp;#8217;s a joint effort from all parties involved to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
