            </header>

            <p>When I <a href="/on-jekyll/">migrated to jekyll</a>, I also wanted to migrate all my comments. My site doesn&rsquo;t have that many of them, so I thought it should have been a doddle to do it, and I was initially firmly set on using <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>. It seemed simple, the embedded code interface didn&rsquo;t look too bad within my new website&rsquo;s design, and I didn&rsquo;t care that much about the fact that it works only with javascript.</p>

<p class="attachement"><span><img src="http://cdn.ekynoxe.com/content/2014-03-18-migrating-comments-and-the-quest-for-a-lightweight-solution/comment.png" alt="comments" /></span></p>

<p>Exporting my comments from Wordpress was very easy through WXR export file, and uploading them to Disqus was equally easy in the first instance.</p>

<p>However, I wasn&rsquo;t just moving my comments from Wordpress to Disqus under the same domain, but also changing said domain. And that&rsquo;s where the shine started to fade.</p>

<p>There is a domain migration tool provided by Disqus, but no matter how much I tried to migrate comments to the new URLs, I couldn&rsquo;t make it work.
Maybe I misunderstood something about the process, but the lack of feedback when creating a URL migration and the lack of documentation around the process is appalling at best.</p>

<p>The basic Disqus interface is probably OK as long as you stay in the confines of the bog-standard pathway, but for anything else, I found it to be very confusing. Very poor instructions, complete lack of feedback, and zero other on-line resources. The experience wasn&rsquo;t great. I even tried to contact their &ldquo;customer support&rdquo; a few times, but there again I didn&rsquo;t receive even the acknowledgement that my request had been received. I still haven&rsquo;t received anything to this day.</p>

<p>Over 5 days of experimentation, I tried to migrate the comments to domains on my local machine with a host file entry and on a real, live, website under a development domain of mine, just in case Disqus' back-end needed to verify that this domain worked somehow. I repeated the whole import / migration a few times, but nothing at all was indicating that I was going in the right direction.</p>

<p>Not a speck of light on anything was visible. So I&rsquo;ve giving up on Disqus. If you&rsquo;re the standard user, you might be OK. If you have other needs: buzz off&hellip;</p>

<p>I had a look at a few other systems like <a href="https://moot.it/">Moot.it</a>, <a href="http://web.livefyre.com/">Livefyre</a>, and some others, but they either are too complex and expensive for what I need, or have no obvious support to import anything.</p>

<p>Given the waste of time, I have therefore pulled the plug entirely on using any existing third party commenting system at the moment. I think I&rsquo;ve even come around to refusing to give the data of my website to a third party at all anyway.</p>

<p>In time, I&rsquo;ll create my very own commenting system, keeping ownership of my comments, and hopefully share that code with everyone for a self hosted solution that one can control entirely. It may be seen as reinventing the wheel, but I&rsquo;ll disagree. I won&rsquo;t create another Disqus, I&rsquo;ll create a solution for geeks who don&rsquo;t mind looking at a little bit of code, but mind a lot about where their content goes.</p>

<p>The basic requirements are pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>A secure API for sending/fetching comments. No need for the posting side of things to even work through an interface</li>
<li>An administration interface to manage comments, edit, delete, spam them etc&hellip; (I don&rsquo;t see myself doing it all command line!)</li>
<li>Comment reply notifications</li>
<li>It must be always on: no &ldquo;Heroku 5 seconds spin up of death scenario&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>Configuration options per post/page to accept/block or enable/disable comments</li>
<li>Spam detection will be a must, and probably the trickiest one. But since a self hosted WP installation does it, there must be a way to replicate this with an Akismet key.</li>
</ul>


<p>Things I don&rsquo;t need or care for</p>

<ul>
<li>Avatars</li>
<li>Discussions. I want this solution to be just comments, and replies to comments. Other systems do discussions, and I&rsquo;ll happily leave it to them!</li>
<li>Fancy mark-up. Everything will start by being stored as escaped HTML. Then it will be up to clients to use the correct parsers/highlighters. Whether they are JavaScript or ruby, I won&rsquo;t care.</li>
</ul>


<p>In the mean time, you can send me an email with your comments, and I&rsquo;ll add them to the statically hosted ones on this site.</p>
